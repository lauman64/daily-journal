# daily-journal
A simple daily journal that saves my posts and displays them.
I designed it to mimic the feel of a real journal. This is clearly seen with the font choice used.

The daily journal is hosted on Heroku and can be found here:

This journal is a task part of an online tutorial and although it is guided,
I always strive to solve things on my own before referring to the guide.
